# Jonas the Robot ü§ñ
Jonas is a hybrid robot developed by the Mechatronics and Robotics Laboratory at UTEC for research and display purposes. Inside this repo, we are sharing the files necessary to enable the main features of Jonas, which include: 

- It can move freely in a 2D terrain due to its three-wheel omnidirectional configuration. 
- It can follow arm movement sequences to salute, give hugs, and dance, among other actions.
- It can be controlled remotely from a PC, as currently, it's not autonomous.  

## Enviroment and Dependencies
Jonas uses ROS Melodic for Ubuntu 18.04, and it depends on the [Dynamixel SDK](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/DynamixelSDK) and PyQt5. However, both dependencies can also be used in a newer version of ROS.
